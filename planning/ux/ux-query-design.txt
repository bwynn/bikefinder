      - How much time do you want to spend on road?
      - Ideally, you want to use this road on...

  2. Experience
    - Drills down into the type of bike experience the user wants to have.
      - How long of a ride?
      - Someone passes you, what do you do?

  3. Investment
    - Gets to the nitty gritty regarding how much money to spend
      - How long do you want to be using this bike?
      - Is this your primary bike?
      - How often will you be riding?


  * NOTES *
  - Include user info tips about why some of these questions are being asked? Helping a user understand why the program suggests a certain quality of bike based on their answers helps them get a realistic idea as to how much they should expect to spend

  - The ability for a user to do a typed search or start a new query based on category criteria will make easy access to the primary function of the app
    eg. A navigation bar that includes a link to the user profile, a text query, or a new search session
