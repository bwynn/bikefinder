// Bike point structure could be determined by bike categories being evaluated by
// value as follows:

Cruiser Bike: 0 - 24 pts
Hybrid Bike: 25 - 49 pts
Road Bike: 50 - 74 pts
Mountain Bike: 75 - 99 pts

// The evaluation of appropriate categories can be based on the average score
// from all of the questions asked

// The scores are determined by the category ranking, which is laid out and ranked
// by ride type intensity. This scale is open to alternative evaluation, but
// at the time of development, this scoring system matches the need to determine
// bike type based on ride intensity, an all day ride is going to be at a higher
// intensity than a cruise around town.
